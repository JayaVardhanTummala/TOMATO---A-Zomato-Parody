## üçÖ **Project Description**

This project is a fun, parody concept of the popular food delivery platform, **Zomato**. Instead of restaurants, TOMATO allows users to discover and find vendors for a variety of premium Indian tomatoes, including _Vaishali_, _Rupali_, _Arka Rakshak_, _Pusa Ruby_, and _Pusa Early Dwarf_.

The landing page is designed to be **visually engaging and modern**, featuring a dynamic, interactive core where users can explore different tomato varieties through a **carousel**. As the user navigates the carousel, the page dynamically updates to show a list of vendors for the selected tomato, creating a seamless and intuitive browsing experience.

This project was built from the ground up as a hands-on learning exercise to master my key front-end technologies and concepts.

## üíª **Technologies Used**

This project was built using a combination of modern front-end technologies:

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** For all custom styling, including the "glassmorphism" effects, layouts, and the scroll-snap feature.
- **Bootstrap 5:** Utilized for its powerful grid system, responsive components (Carousel, Cards), and utility classes to accelerate development.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Used to create the core interactive logic that links the Bootstrap carousel's slide events to the visibility of the vendor card sections.
